# The Long Road

> Being a professional programmer takes time    
> The road is long and winding.    
> To walk alone would be a crime    
> Together there is knowledge for the finding.    

## Philosophy
There are two sides to effectiveness as a developer:
* Capability - what you can accomplish
* Comprehension - what you understand

Excellent developers constantly push themselves to expand both their capability
to build systems via high level tools and their comprehension of the core
building blocks of computing.

Together we will build projects using capability focused
technologies such as Rails, jQuery, Bootstrap, and more.

We will also explore the core protocols, languages, and other fundamental
technologies that underly the web.


## Structure
The study group meets weekly to:

* Review code written during the previous week
* Share short talks on a valuable thing learned during the week
* Prepare for the next weeks project(s)

## Participation
Participation is limited to ~12 people who commit to 4 weeks in a row. This
allows people to rotate in and out based on their personal commitments.
